Hi, I am **Xiangfei Kong**! I am a Computer Science and Engineering Ph.D. student at the University of South Florida and joined the RARE Lab in October 2023 as a M.S. student. I completed my Bachelor of Arts degree from Qufu Normal University in China and my dual M.S. in Marketing and Computer Science from USF. In addition, I received a Pathway to Computing Graduate Certificate in Spring 2023 before transitioning from marketing to CS.

My main research interest is leveraging augmented reality (AR) for the replicability and reproducibility of empirical experiment results. Specifically, I am investigating whether AR virtual robots can be a possible replacement for physical robots in some empirical research focusing on subjective experience.
