This workshop paper presents research on leveraging augmented reality (AR) for bridging virtual robots and physical interactions in empirical studies. The work investigates whether AR virtual robots can serve as viable replacements for physical robots in certain types of human-robot interaction research, particularly those focusing on subjective experience and user perception.

The paper was presented at the WYSD (YOUR Study Design!) workshop, which focuses on participatory critique and refinement of human-robot interaction user studies. This workshop provides a venue for discussing methodological approaches and study design considerations in HRI research.

**Key contributions:**
- Investigation of AR as a tool for improving replicability and reproducibility in HRI experiments
- Exploration of virtual robot representations in augmented reality environments  
- Analysis of the potential for AR virtual robots to replace physical robots in specific research contexts
