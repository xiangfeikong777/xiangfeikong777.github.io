This workshop paper addresses a fundamental question in human-robot interaction research: whether experimental results obtained with virtual robots in augmented reality environments can reliably transfer to interactions with physical robots. The study presents a carefully designed experiment to test this transferability hypothesis.

The paper was presented at the WYSD (YOUR Study Design!) workshop, which focuses on participatory critique and refinement of human-robot interaction user studies. This workshop provides a venue for discussing methodological approaches and study design considerations in HRI research.

**Key contributions:**
- Systematic investigation of result transferability between virtual AR robots and physical robots
- Novel experimental design for testing cross-platform validity in HRI studies
- Analysis of factors affecting the generalizability of virtual robot interaction results
- Framework for improving replicability and reproducibility in HRI experiments through AR technology
