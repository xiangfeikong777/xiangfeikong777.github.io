## Team Members
**Andrew Texeira, Rex Allen Gonzalez, Deep Akbari, Sofia Cobo Navas, Thuc Anh Nguyen**  
Five undergraduate students at University of South Florida

## Mentoring Period
**May 2025 – Present**  
*RARE Lab Social Project, Tampa, FL, USA*

## Project Focus
Socially Assistive Robotics for Elderly Care

## Project Overview
Leading the development of a socially assistive robot designed to support older adults through interactive engagement and assistance.

## Mentoring Activities

### Technical Leadership
- **Robot Shell Design**: Advised on robot shell design to ensure user acceptance while allowing proper integration of all hardware components
- **Speech Integration**: Guided the implementation of speech-to-text modules and robot emotional motion design for natural and engaging interactions
- **AI Development**: Mentored the development of text-to-speech functionality and custom LLM prompts for personalized dialogue generation

### Advanced Features
- **Computer Vision**: Supported camera-based face recognition pipeline development for context-aware human-robot interaction
- **User Interface**: Mentored UI design (Flask) and development for user information input, ensuring accessibility and ease of use for the experimenter
- **System Integration**: Supervised integration of multiple subsystems into cohesive robot platform

## Technical Stack
- **Hardware Integration**: Multi-component robot system design
- **Natural Language Processing**: Speech-to-text, text-to-speech, custom LLM integration
- **Computer Vision**: Face recognition and tracking systems
- **Web Development**: Flask-based user interface
- **Human-Robot Interaction**: Emotional motion design and social robotics principles

## Skills Developed by Team
- **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Hardware-software integration
- **Social Robotics**: Understanding of HRI principles and elderly care applications
- **AI/ML Implementation**: Practical application of NLP and computer vision
- **User-Centered Design**: Accessibility and usability considerations
- **Project Management**: Large-scale collaborative development

## Project Impact
This capstone project addresses real-world challenges in elderly care through innovative robotics solutions, providing students with valuable experience in socially assistive robotics while contributing to meaningful research in human-robot interaction.

## Current Status
**Ongoing** - Project continues with regular mentoring sessions and milestone reviews to ensure successful completion and deployment.
