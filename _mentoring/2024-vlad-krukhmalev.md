## Students Background
**Vlad Krukhmalev & Tu Nguyen** - Computer Science undergraduate students at University of South Florida

## Mentoring Period
**Dec 2024 – Aug 2025**  
*RARE Lab, Tampa, FL, USA*

## Project Focus
Comprehensive ROS Development and GitHub Collaboration

## Mentoring Activities

### Core ROS Training
- **Beginner ROS Curriculum**: Mentored two CS undergraduate students in learning Robot Operating Systems (ROS) from beginner level
- **GitHub Workflows**: Guided students in learning and implementing GitHub project workflows and pull request processes
- **Unity Integration**: Assisted students in developing Unity projects for deployment on HoloLens 2

### Advanced Development
- **Mixed Reality Development**: Guided project setup and Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) integration
- **Application Deployment**: Supervised application deployment processes for HoloLens 2 platform
- **Synchronization Systems**: Guided students in learning and working with the fkie_multimaster package to establish one-way synchronization of specific ROS topics and nodes between two ROS hosts

## Skills Developed
- **ROS Fundamentals**: Node creation, topic communication, service calls
- **Version Control**: Git workflows, pull requests, collaborative development
- **Mixed Reality**: HoloLens 2 development, MRTK integration
- **Network Programming**: ROS multi-master setup and synchronization
- **Project Management**: Collaborative development practices

## Technical Achievements
- Successfully implemented ROS multi-host communication
- Deployed functional applications on HoloLens 2
- Established efficient GitHub collaboration workflows
- Configured complex ROS network synchronization

## Outcomes
Both students progressed from ROS beginners to competent developers capable of working with advanced ROS networking, mixed reality development, and collaborative software development practices.
